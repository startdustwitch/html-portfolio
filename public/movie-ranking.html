<p>The Mitchells are a dysfunctional family.But when their road trip is interrupted by a robot apocalypse,they are forced to get their act together and try to save the world. Will they be able to?<br/>
    <br/>
     This is one of the best animated adventure comedy films in recent years.</p>

<h3>Jathi Rathnalu</h3>

<p> This film is an Indian Telugu comedy drama.(I love comedy, haha! We could all use a little humour!)<br/>
    Three simpletons head to the city looking for jobs to gain dignity and respect in society and...well...things do not go as planned.<br/>
    This films drips with family-friendly humour,the characters are unique and bizzare, contributing to the craziness of the film. This film is a must watch indeed!</p>
<h3>The Breadwinner</h3>

<p>An animated ( yup, I love animation too!), drama film  about Parvana, an eleven year old girl, and her struggle to provide for her family under the Taliban.<br/>
One of the most beautiful films I have ever watched. This film will leave you feeling a mix of indescribable emotions.This is a must watch. </p>
